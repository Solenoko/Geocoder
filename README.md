🎨 Background Effects
Added  dynamic background effects to enhance the look of the app:

Background Gradient Animation:

The background is animated with a smooth gradient transition between colors, providing a soothing, dynamic visual effect.

Floating Particle Effect:

Implemented floating particles that subtly move up and down, creating a calming, magical atmosphere. These particles are created using an animation keyframe, making them flow in and out of the view.

Background Box with Blur:

The box containing the main content (the map and input fields) has a blurred background with a soft shadow to make the content pop. This box has an animated glow effect, adding an extra touch of magic to the interface.

These effects are added to improve the user experience and make the app visually engaging without distracting from its functionality. Here's how they work:

The background gradient constantly shifts between colors, ensuring the interface feels fresh and dynamic.

The floating particles gently move up and down, adding subtle movement to the background.

The background box inside the .container element has a backdrop blur effect, giving it a glass-like appearance, with a smooth glow animation to catch the user’s eye.
